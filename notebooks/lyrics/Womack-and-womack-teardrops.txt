Whenever I hear goodbyes
(Remind me baby of you)
I break down and cry
(The next time I'll be true, yeah)
Fever for lost romance
(Remind me baby of you)
I took a crazy chance
(The next time I'll be true
I'll be true, I'll be true)

Footsteps on the dance floor
(Remind me baby of you)
Teardrops in my eyes
(Next time I'll be true, yeah)
Whispers in the powder room
(She cries on every tune
Every tune, every tune)

And the music don't feel
Like it did when I felt it with you
Nothing that I do or feel ever feels
Like I felt it with you

When I'm dancin' 'round
(Remind me baby of you)
I really let you down
(Next time I'll be true, yeah)
I took a crazy chance
(She cries on every tune
Every tune, every tune)

Footsteps on the dance floor
(Remind me baby of you)
Teardrops in my eyes
(Next time I'll be true, yeah)
Whispers in the powder room
(She cries on every tune
Every tune, every tune)

And the music don't feel
Like it did when I felt it with you
Nothing that I do or feel ever feels
Like I felt it with you

Hurting deep inside
(She cries on every tune)
I break down and cry
(She cries on every tune
Every tune, every tune)

Footsteps on the dance floor
(Remind me baby of you)
Teardrops in my eyes
(Next time I'll be true, yeah)
Whispers in the powder room
(She cries on every tune
Every tune, every tune)

And the music don't feel (no no)
Like it did when I felt it with you
(No no)
Nothing that I do or feel (never feels)
Like I felt it with you
(No no)

And the music don't feel (no no)
Like it did when I felt it with you
Nothing that I do or feel
Ever feels like I felt it with you

Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh ohh

Fever for lost romance
I took a crazy chance
Lovers holding hands
(Remind me baby of you)
(Next time I'll be true)
